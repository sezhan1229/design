import {Box, Flex, BorderBox, Text} from '@primer/components'

This is a guide for designing onboarding for the product and does not include what to do for marketing pages, email announcements, social media, etc.

When designing a feature onboarding flow, you should:

- ‚úÖ Think creatively utilizing different ways to onboard users, such as empty states and off-product avenues.
- ‚úÖ For feature annoucements, prepare a release timeline to call out new features.
- üö´ Do not leave feature annoucement campaigns running forever.

# How to implement feature onboarding
## Proximity and proportion
- Onboarding elements should maintain an appropriate proximity to where the feature will live in perpetuity.
- Consider the primary job to be done on a page before disrupting the user with a feature callout. 
- Keep in mind the context, placement, and dominance of an onboarding element. 
- Onboarding UI choices should be proportional to the hierarchy of the feature on the page.

## Set clear campaign limits
- Use feature onboarding components for a limited time.
- Make it clear to the user how they may dismiss the message and return to their original task quickly. 
- Define clear paramaters for why, when, and how often a user may see a onboarding message.

- **Define triggers**
  - System tiggers, e.g. a new feature released, a user should not need to dismiss the same annoucement each time they visit a different repository.
  - User triggers, e.g. a user visits a specific repository for the first time, if recurring, a user should feel added value each time they see the message.    
- **Timebox**
  - Maximum number of days a coordinated campaign will run across all targeted users.
  - Maximum number of times a user will see an in-product message until dismissed.

## Avoid traffic collisions
- Avoid showing too many alerts at the same time. Collisions are awkward and undesirable, no more than 2 alerts a time. 
- Consider what other alerts, teaching bubbles, or banners may be active on the page before launching your onboarding experience.

## Create efficient sequences
Sequence tasks in a logical way to increase onboarding success. Clearly define when someone has started setup and successfully completed your flow. Treat your feature onboarding as a story or a journey with a:

- Start to setup the beginning journey of your onboarding experience.
- Define the transition of your onboarding flow.
- Take the users to the end of onboading success. 

## Draw attention to your feature
Use teaching bubbles, alert banners, the feature preview tray, or announcement modals to draw attention to your feature.

- ‚úÖ Use empty states or alert banners to call attention to a feature if users will discover your feature in order to start a task
- ‚úÖ Use teaching bubbles or other easily dismissable elements if users will discover your feature while they are completing another task

## Begin a setup flow
Use [empty states](https://primer.style/design/ui-patterns/empty-states), [teaching bubbles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office-ui-fabric-react/iteachingbubbleprops?view=office-ui-fabric-react-latest), or a [CTA on a marketing page](https://github.com/features/actions) on GitHub to begin a setup flow.

![Actions example 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47256527/89215079-d4bc6980-d57c-11ea-981b-bc7ea6d07493.png)

## Guide your user through their task
Use a [form](https://primer.style/css/components/forms), [checklist](https://primer.style/css/components/forms), or other UI elements to help users complete their task. 

![Checklist example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47256527/88720479-c7fdc880-d0d9-11ea-9ac1-76b9defafe79.png)

## Celebrate the finish
Use a toast, flash alert, or other message to confirm the user has completed their task. Message should be short and brief.

# Teaching bubble
Teaching bubbles are a special [popover]() that calls attention to a feature in a specific part of the page. Generally, features highlighted by teaching bubbles should be used to educate the user and enriching to the user‚Äôs task at hand. Consider the page the user is currently viewing and what jobs-to-be-done they may be performing.

|Pattern |Quickstart| Top user benefits|
|:--|:--|:--|
|Whent to use |<li>Call attention to new or important features</li><li>Invoked by the system, like a new capability being available</li>|The highlighted feature extends or improves the user's likely task at hand|
|When not to use |<li>Don't point to hidden elements</li><li>If the user cannot immediately interact and benefit from the feature highlighted</li>|Do not distract the user from completing their task.|

## General guidelines
Refer to the [Primer popover component](https://primer.style/css/components/popover) for more detailed implementation guidelines.

```html live title="Basic"
<div class="Popover right-0 left-0 position-relative">
  <div class="Popover-message text-left p-4 mt-2 mx-auto Box box-shadow-large">
    <h4 class="mb-2">Teaching bubble heading</h4>
    <p>Use this as a teaching moment that may enrich a user‚Äôs experience. Keep message to a maximum of 160 characters.</p>
    <button class="btn btn-sm btn-outline mt-2" type="button">Primary action</button>
    <button class="btn btn-invisible ml-2">Ok, dismiss</button>
  </div>
</div>
```

- Show one teaching bubble at a time.
- Recommended to include a headline that states the purpose of the message.
- Keep your message short and pithy, around 160 characters. 
- If additional information must be added, consider a stepped guide or a ‚ÄúLearn more‚Äù link that opens in a new window or tab. 
- It is preferable to use a descriptive dismiss button (e.g. ‚ÄúOk, got it‚Äù or ‚ÄúDone‚Äù) over a close icon; if a close icon must be used, remember to apply the correct tab order and polite annoucements for screenreaders.
-If a guided feature setup is needed in a recurring manner, consider using other more inline ‚Ä®patterns like empty states in lieu of teaching bubbles.
- Keep your copy to maximum 160 characters.

### Multiple calls to action
The default dismissal button should say ‚ÄúOk, got it‚Äù as a way to inject more personality while reaffirming with ‚Äúok‚Äù which internationalizes better as a more commonly recognized phrase. As a secondary call to action, it should be ‚ÄúOk, dismiss.‚Äù

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6744014/88741737-43b93e80-d0f5-11ea-8445-5b878607756e.png" width="180"/></p>

If the primary action is not to dismiss the teaching bubble, they should invite the user to engage with the value proposition promised. Call to actions in teach bubbles should not take the user away from their current page. 

Actions that take the user to a new page may only be linked from the copy and must open in a new tab or window to prevent loosing the user‚Äôs context.

**Condensed**

Use a close icon only for condensed messages that have no primary call to action. Remember to set the correct aria order for screen readers to easily dismiss the teaching bubble at the end of the message.

# Inline feature discovery

A banner that appears inline often used as a way to reveal hidden features in more obscure parts of GitHub. Do not persist the banner without an ability to dismiss on a ‚Äúcore‚Äù high traffic page.

If there must be a visible inline banner, it should only persist for a specified amount of time. Consider using other feature annoucement UI patterns or marketing strategies rather than bombarding the user with annoucements in their place of work.

## Page banner

Page banners are used for annoucements that are relevant to the core job to be done on the current page.

## Inline feature highlight

### Inline banners

On a page with multiple steps or actions, highlight a feature inline close to where it would be logical to extend the user‚Äôs experience. Consider [alerts]() with branded elements as a way to implement these messages.

  <BorderBox width={12 / 12} border="1px solid" borderColor="gray.3" mb="2">

  </BorderBox>
</Flex>

**Hidden revealed**

In certain scenarios, we release features that are hidden for the user to discover. Encourage the user by showing confirmation messages at pivotal moments or give more resources. Refer to the [Primer alert component](). 

Typically, this is paired with other off-platform ways to discover the feature like a blog post or other marketing efforts. Be sure to have clear documentation in GitHub Docs or other applicable user facing resources.

### Empty states
Use empty states as an integrated way to onboard users to new features. Read more about [empty states]().

**In-product marketing empty state**

A first time experience may be more unique than the typical blank state. For special occasions, take a more branded approach to engage and guide the user through complex experiences. Be aware of how the experience will change once the first time UI is no longer there.

# Designated feature discovery areas
Designated feature area generally detached from where the feature actually lives and have a clear click through to try out the feature or learn more.

## Dashboard feature bulletin
The top of the right sidebar in a user‚Äôs dashabord (logged-in home) is a designated area for feature discovery. They take the user directly to the feature in the product or the relevant marketing pages.

**Basic announcement guidelines**
‚Ä¢ Limit messages to around 160 characters. 
‚Ä¢ If there is a click through, include a clear call-to-action button; avoid hidden links.
‚Ä¢ Use color, with discretion, to spotlight and bring brand feature personality to the annoucement.

## Beta feature preview dialog
Feature previews allow teams to test features in production with users who opt in. A feature under the beta preview will be added to the Feature Preview dialog, accessible through the user dropdown

Please note, features in Beta testing are strongly advised to have a comprehensive release and redaction plan. No feature should remain in Beta for longer than X months unmonitored.

# Flairs
Flairs are subtler ways to accentuate new features. They are a good alternative to call attention to new things without derailing the user from their primary job to be done. 

Consider using flairs for features that appear in a user‚Äôs current view but may navigate away from their current page. They may also be applicable for smaller features that appear inline that more self-explainatory and do not need a teaching bubble. 

See Primer documentation on labels and muted links for detailed implementation guidelines.

**Beta**
Beta tags are applicable for feature previews. They may be accompanied by a feedback link which is encouraged but not required, depending on space constraints.

**New**
For new features that are released to production with a GA scope. The new flair should be timed and not overstay it‚Äôs welcome, generally a feature may be considered ‚Äúnew‚Äù for 2 months. 

Include a link to relevant marketing pages or changelog entries where possible.
