This is a guide for designing onboarding for the product and does not include what to do for marketing pages, email announcements, social media, etc.

When designing a feature onboarding flow, you should:

- âœ… Think creatively utilizing different ways to onboard users, such as empty states and off-product avenues.
- âœ… For feature annoucements, prepare a release timeline to call out new features.
- ðŸš« Do not leave feature annoucement campaigns running forever.

# How to implement feature onboarding
## Proximity and proportion
- Onboarding elements should maintain an appropriate proximity to where the feature will live in perpetuity.
- Consider the primary job to be done on a page before disrupting the user with a feature callout. 
- Keep in mind the context, placement, and dominance of an onboarding element. 
- Onboarding UI choices should be proportional to the hierarchy of the feature on the page.

## Set clear campaign limits
- Use feature onboarding components for a limited time.
- Make it clear to the user how they may dismiss the message and return to their original task quickly. 
- Define clear paramaters for why, when, and how often a user may see a onboarding message.

- **Define triggers**
  - System tiggers, e.g. a new feature released, a user should not need to dismiss the same annoucement each time they visit a different repository.
  - User triggers, e.g. a user visits a specific repository for the first time, if recurring, a user should feel added value each time they see the message.    
- **Timebox**
  - Maximum number of days a coordinated campaign will run across all targeted users.
  - Maximum number of times a user will see an in-product message until dismissed.

## Avoid traffic collisions
- Avoid showing too many alerts at the same time. Collisions are awkward and undesirable, no more than 2 alerts a time. 
- Consider what other alerts, teaching bubbles, or banners may be active on the page before launching your onboarding experience.

## Create efficient sequences
Sequence tasks in a logical way to increase onboarding success. Clearly define when someone has started setup and successfully completed your flow. Treat your feature onboarding as a story or a journey with a:

- Start to setup the beginning journey of your onboarding experience.
- Define the transition of your onboarding flow.
- Take the users to the end of onboading success. 

## Draw attention to your feature
Use teaching bubbles, alert banners, the feature preview tray, or announcement modals to draw attention to your feature.

- âœ… Use empty states or alert banners to call attention to a feature if users will discover your feature in order to start a task
- âœ… Use teaching bubbles or other easily dismissable elements if users will discover your feature while they are completing another task

## Begin a setup flow
Use [empty states](https://primer.style/design/ui-patterns/empty-states), [teaching bubbles](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/office-ui-fabric-react/iteachingbubbleprops?view=office-ui-fabric-react-latest), or a [CTA on a marketing page](https://github.com/features/actions) on GitHub to begin a setup flow.

## Guide your user through their task
Use a [form](https://primer.style/css/components/forms), [checklist](https://primer.style/css/components/forms), or other UI elements to help users complete their task.

## Celebrate the finish
Use a toast, flash alert, or other message to confirm the user has completed their task. Message should be short and brief.
